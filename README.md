##  Overview

NmapBuddy is a Python-based tool that automates port scanning and basic vulnerability detection using Nmap.  
It streamlines manual security assessments by allowing users to quickly identify open ports and potential vulnerabilities on target systems or networks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

To get started with NmapBuddy, follow these steps:

```bash
1. Clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/Thorne10/NmapBuddy.git
   cd NmapBuddy

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
   python -m venv scanner_env
   source scanner_env/bin/activate   # For Mac/Linux
   scanner_env\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

3. Install required dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Launch the project
   jupyter notebook

## üïí Logging
Every scan is logged automatically in `scan_log.txt`, located in the main project directory. Logs include:

- The target host
- Output format chosen (text or JSON)
- A timestamp of when the scan was completed

This helps track scanning activity over time and supports record-keeping for compliance or analysis.

## üéØ Target Selection
NmapBuddy accepts multiple targets in a single input session. When prompted, you can enter one or more IP addresses or domain names separated by spaces:


The tool will loop through each target and allow individual output format selection per host.

## ‚ö° Nmap Scan Execution
The core of the project uses the `python-nmap` library to:

- Scan ports in the range 20‚Äì100
- Identify open ports and their associated services
- Return scan data in a structured format

Scans are performed with a timeout-safe method and basic error handling to skip invalid or unreachable targets.
